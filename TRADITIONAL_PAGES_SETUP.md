# Traditional GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## The Problem
GitHub Actions workflows were failing to deploy. Using traditional method instead.

## Manual Setup Required

**You need to configure GitHub Pages manually:**

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/redmorestudio/ai-competitor-monitor/settings/pages

2. **Set Source:** "Deploy from a branch"

3. **Set Branch:** "main"

4. **Set Folder:** "/ (root)"

5. **Click Save**

## Why This Works
- GitHub automatically detects `index.html` in root
- No complex workflows needed
- Deploys automatically on every push to main
- More reliable than Actions approach

## After Setup
Your dashboard will be available at:
https://redmorestudio.github.io/ai-competitor-monitor/

With v51 features including:
- ✅ TheBrain integration (6th tab)
- ✅ Enhanced dashboard
- ✅ All advanced features

**Status:** Waiting for manual Pages configuration
